# Mini-Project

The University Management System is a simple object-oriented programming Java project designed to showcase the implementation of various classes and their interactions within a university setting.
We have implemented different classes , each represents a sepcific part of the university .

-Human class is a class with attributs and methods needed by every human such as fullName and Age..
-Student class herits from Human and has some additional methods and attributes special for Students , Same for Teacher class and Admin Class.
-We also created classes for classrooms , clubs , courses , exams , subjects and testSheet .
-These classes are used as attributs in the classes Herited from Human to organise their functionalities.

In the main App , we used Human type and used casting to avoid execution errors .
